    <h4>Directions</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the rice in a strainer until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>
                Combine rice and water in a saucepan, then bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook
                for about 20 minutes until rice is tender and water is absorbed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over low heat; stir for 1 to 2 minutes
                until the sugar is dissolved. Pour sushi vinegar over rice, then stir until rice cools and looks dry.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Arrange the shrimp tempura on the baking sheet.</li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for about 6 minutes per side, until golden and crispy. Cut tails off 4 of the
                shrimp tempura.
            </li>

            <!-- Consider adding these steps to another ordered list titled, Assembly-->

            <li>
                Cover a bamboo sushi mat with plastic wrap. Lay 1 nori sheet, shiny-side down, on the plastic wrap.
                Spread 1 cup of rice on top using moistened fingers, leaving a <em>1/3</em>-inch border. Flip nori so
                rice is facing the mat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Arrange imitation crabmeat and cucumber along the bottom edge of the nori sheet. Place 2 tail-off shrimp 
                in the center of the nori sheet. Place 2 tail-on shrimp on the end so that the tails extend over the 
                sides of the sheet. Lift the edge of the bamboo rolling mat, and roll up nori into a tight log around the
                filling.
            <li>
                Transfer sushi roll to a serving plate. Layer advocado and unagi slices on top to cover the top and sides
                of the roll. Slice the roll into 8 pieces using a moisted knife.
            </li>
            <li>
                Repeat with remaining nori, rice, crabmeat, cucumber, advocado, and unagi to make a second roll. If
                desired, put tobiko on each sushi then drizzle spicy mayo and sprinkle black sesame seeds on top.
            </li>
            <li>Serve dragon sushi rolls, and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
